**Implementation of B+-tree indexing system from hashtable, as part of Swarthmore CPSC 044: Database Systems**

**Authors**: Oscar Chen, Aly Valliani

We implementated a B+-Tree database indexing system for storing ordered key-value tuples. Using C++ and provided API endpoints

### Contents: 
1. **btree.h** - B+-Tree impelementation header file
2. **btree.cpp** - B+-Tree implementation
3. **main.cpp** - Main program for populating index from file and running scan, insert, and delete methods on B+-tree. Also contains tests with ordered, randomly generated, and curated test records.
